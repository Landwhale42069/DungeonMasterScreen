# Synopsis
The adventurers are part of an experiment to try and combine the souls of different lifeforms into one super being. They want this to be able to achieve godhood and shape the world to their dark wills. 

The ritual used to combine the lifeforms are based on old magic that favors comradery over raw power. While in an early stage of the fusion ritual, our adventurers might have the power needed to beat the [[Important Character]].
